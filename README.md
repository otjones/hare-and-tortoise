 - NOTES

MAX 6 players

Type as instructed and press Enter key to continue

Recommended to keep player names short, as they must be typed in to make each move

Each turn, type in each player's move so the computer knows what's going on.

Simply enter the number of squares moved and cost
e.g. Moved: 10 Cost -55 means move forward 10 and spent 55 carrots
e.g. Moved -4 Cost 40 means move backwards 4 and gain 40 carrots
e.g. Moved: 0 Cost: 20 means stay on square and gain 20 carrots (if on a lettuce square for example)
e.g. Moved: 0 Cost: -10 means stay on square and lose 10 carrots (for example if on carrot square)

The computer will automatically give players carrots if they begin their turn on the square equal to their position
*** added carrots *** will show

Move confirmation will also be shown

The computer will move itself and tell you the move in the form (move, cost) e.g. (10,-55) and will say the square
